/**
 * A condition which is continuously checked over the course of a simulation run. Whenever the
 * condition is satisfied, the <code>check</code> method performs a specific action, such as
 * stopping the simulation run, for example.
 * <p>
 * A common use of this class is the implementation of a stop condition, which causes the simulation
 * run to stop whenever the <code>check</code> method evaluates to <code>true</code>.
