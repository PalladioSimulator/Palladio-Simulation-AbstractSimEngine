/**
 * The simulation model is the central class of a discrete-event system simulator.
 * <p>
 * Its <code>init</code> method is the entry point of each simulation run in that it schedules
 * initial events that put the simulation into operation. For this, the simulation model relies on a
 * simulation library (which is also referred to as simulation engine), which offers means to create
 * and schedule events (or processes, respectively), which are then executed at the intended
 * simulation time.
 * <p>
 * The methods <code>getSimEngineFactory</code> and <code>getSimulationControl</code> both provide
 * access to simulation library services, where the former focuses on the creation of events and
 * processes, for instance, and the latter offers means to control the simulation run (e.g. to start
 * and stop the simulation).
 * <p>
 * Notice, that the term <i>model</i> refers to the circumstance that the simulation model is an
 * abstraction of a real-world system in that it imitates the system's behaviour.
